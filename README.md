# Miscellaneous Vector Tile Applications

This is a demo application using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) to quickly style Vector Tiles.
This demo using a [Colour Palette Generator](https://github.com/google/palette.js) from Google to create the [ColorBewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) palettes.

The source Vector Tile style has been trimmed down to only 24 layers and 8 unique colors, so the colors are updated very naively.
This is only meant for demonstration purposes.
You could build upon these output styles and modify as needed for your needs.
